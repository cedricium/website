It's approximately 11 PM on Sunday and I still have not written anything for the
day. [I mentioned yesterday](./my-desired-writing-style) that it is easy for me
to come up with many shallow writing topics, and the opposite of that is also
true: I find it hard to come up with a few "deep" ideas worth exploring.

Its the same dilemma I face as an indie maker: I can never think of any
interesting ideas to build.

I think I'm falling into the trap of "what do people want to read about" rather
than writing about my interests. David Perell sums it up nicely: "The biggest
mistake new Internet writers is writing about what they think other people want
to read instead of following their obsessions."<sup>1</sup>

Any time I start something new, I seek out the work of others who are successful
and try to mimic their work. For example, when designing the landing page for
Unearth I found inspiration in the Netlify and Slab websites.

It seems as though writing is no different. I think if I am going to improve, I
must mimic my favorite authors' work while applying it to my own.

I honestly don't even know where I am going with this. This writing thing is
making me frustrated so I'm just going to publish and call it a day. ðŸ¤¬
