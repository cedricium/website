It is only the third day since I started my writing challenge and I already
almost missed a day.

I didn't feel like writing so me explaining why that is the case will count
towards my writing for the day. (Ahh, the powers that come with being the one to
set the rulesâ€”but I digress.)

I woke up this morning around my usual time, 6:00AM sharp. I then immediately
jumped on Twitter to scope out the day's hottest stocks. For the past three
months I have been trading small-cap stocks using Robinhood (note to self: this
could be a good future topic).

I trade for a couple hours then prepare for my day, doing tasks like eating
breakfast, brushing my teeth, and showering. Once finished with all that, I
start work right around 9AM.

Work has been incredibly fun and interesting lately. For the past five weeks or
so the frontend team has been busy tackling a few different Jira epics that
encapsulate some cool new features.

I only stepped away from my work laptop a few minutes ago to start writing this.
I have a headache from staring at screens all day as I so tend to do. I really
ought to get out of the house more often during this shelter-in-place.

A combination of a headache and mushy brain after work is the reason why I did
not feel like writing.

But isn't that the point of a challenge? Nobody said it would be easy, and if it
was, everyone would be doing it. Just have to push through!
