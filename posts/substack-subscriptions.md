  "Why subscription-only monetization is misaligned—and how a dual model of
  subscriptions and per-post payments might fix it."

From household utilities, to streaming services like Netflix, or even unlocking
more horsepower out of one's vehicle<sup>1</sup>, as consumers it's nearly
impossible to not be indebted some way or another to the recurring monetization
model known as subscriptions.

Having built SaaS companies as a software engineer, I understand why the
subscription model is desirable for businesses. In exchange for access to a good
or service, predictable recurring revenue helps streamline accounting and ease
other back office functions like scaling systems or improving customer
relationships.

For many of those reasons, subscriptions are the de facto monetization method
used by digital publishing platforms like Medium and Substack. These platforms
have enabled independent writers to get paid for their work, often supported
directly by loyal patrons via recurring payments.

### Substack’s Model Doesn’t Scale for Readers

Unlike the Medium model where readers pay a single subscription fee for "Medium
Membership," giving them access to all paid content on the platform across
writers/publications, Substack's model differs in that each individual
publication has their own subscription (pricing them as they see fit), which is
required to read monetized content on that publication alone.

Whereas it only costs $5 per month to become a Medium Member, subscriptions on
Substack aren't nearly as inexpensive, and their combined costs quickly add up.
Paid access for a Substack publication costs anywhere between $5 to $20 per
month from what I've seen personally. Of the 10 publications I follow on
Substack, five of those are monetized: three cost $10/month, one is $8/month,
and the other is $15/month (yearly plans typically offer 2 months free or a 17%
discount). Assuming I paid for access at the discounted yearly rate for all
five, I'd be spending close to $550/year to support just five writers. That's
about 4x more expensive than Amazon Prime or 8x the price of a Costco Gold
membership!

In his essay titled
[_Thoughts on Substack’s Subscription Model_](https://jamierubin.net/2022/01/27/thoughts-on-substacks-subscription-model/),
writer Jamie Todd Rubin corroborates this prohibitive pricing: "You can see the
problem. Each of these newsletters/blogs is worth the money to subscribe to
them, at least to me. But in combination they add up quickly. In total we’re
talking about $170/year for 3 newsletters/blogs. This doesn’t seem scalable to
me." He continues, "The problem is, as more and more writers move to this model,
it becomes harder and harder for readers to fork out limited funds to support
them. If ten writer I really loved to read had subscriptions on Substack for
$60/year each, that would cost $600/year to read all of them. That’s a lot of
money."

### Cost Isn’t the Only Constraint

Not to mention I don't even have time to read all of the content I have access
to as a subscriber. Just as I'm limited monetarily with who I can subscribe to,
I'm also limited temporally by how much content I can consume. Readers on the
platform like myself are forced to be selective of who they choose to support
because of these limitations.

When access demands a recurring fee, and in that moment, you only have so much
time and mental capacity to consume a limited amount of content at the time of
purchase, the thought of remembering or even scheduling the cancellation of the
subscription becomes too big a hurdle to even complete the checkout process.
This binary "all or nothing" problem caused by Substack's singular
subscription-only model is why a majority of readers don't convert to paid
subscribers and thus writers end up leaving money on the table.

<summary><strong>Medium Isn't Perfect</strong></summary>

For what it's worth, Medium's model is not without its issues. Because readers
pay Medium directly, they in turn must divide the sum of subscription revenue
(less whatever fees required to run the platform) following a distribution model
to calculate the exact payout per writer. Despite outlining
[how payouts are calculated](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036691193-Calculating-earnings-in-the-Partner-Program),
many writers struggle with maintaining any sort of predictable income month to
month. In her article
[_After 3 years and $11,000, I’m leaving Medium_](https://medium.com/@rosiehoggmascall/after-3-years-and-11-000-im-leaving-medium-333d3e5dcc8c),
Rosie Hoggmascall outlines the minutiae of Medium payouts: "The real issue is
not the amounts, but the unpredictability. If earning is your goal, this
bumpyness pushes writers to cross post elsewhere to spread risk. Virality is the
only reliable path to earn on Medium — and that is impossible to produce
consistently… If a reader loves a specific writer, there’s no guarantee their
subscription supports their work."

### The Missing Middle Ground

I can't help but think there has to be a better way for readers to support their
favorite writers without compromising writers' own compensation. If a
profit-sharing method can't guarantee writers being paid fairly, and a separate
subscription per publication is cost prohibitive for readers wanting to support
more than a handful of writers, where's the middle ground?

I believe the solution can be found in other creator economy platforms like
OnlyFans, Patreon, or Twitch, where hybrid monetization methods are enabled,
giving fans the ability to support creators how they see fit.

For Substack—where writers have greater control over their content and
pricing—this would look like a micropayments or pay-per-post model, where
instead of requiring readers to subscribe to unlock all content, they could be
more selective with their funds and opt to read what's truly interesting to
them. Give readers the option to pay something like $1 to $5 to unlock a paid
post rather than needing to sign up for a recurring $10 fee just to read a few
articles (and that $10 investment snowballing into $20, $30, $40 when they
inevitably forget to cancel their subscription 4+ months later).

Just to be clear: micropayments should be enabled _in addition to_ paid
subscriptions. Subscriptions make the most sense for those who not only have the
monetary means for supporting their favorite writers, but also consume most or
all of the creator's content to begin with. Micropayments, on the other hand,
allow those like myself who might be financially strapped or aren't familiar
with a particular writer and fully committed to subscribing just yet<sup>2</sup>
to get a taste of their work without the hassle of committing to a subscription.

To reiterate, Substack should allow publications to not only offer course meals,
but also include an à la carte option. As a reader, this dual system gives me
the choice to enjoy content I'd want to read without having to overspend on
content I might not consume otherwise. This in turn opens an additional revenue
stream for writers while still being supported by their paid subscribers.

Some may argue one-time payments would cannibalize the higher-value
subscriptions, but I like to think of a single post purchase as a paid sample or
warm lead. A reader who pays $2 for one article is more likely to subscribe
later than random cold traffic. Writers are then capturing revenue from people
burdened by subscription fatigue who would otherwise pay $0.

This solution seems sound in theory, but would it have any meaningful impact in
practice if actually implemented?
