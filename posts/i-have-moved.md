No, I haven't moved physically. Rather, I've moved my blog. My first blog,
*coffee. code. cedric*, was hosted on Medium when that was the cool thing to do.
I even had a custom domain for my publication before that
[feature was steamrolled](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003053487
-Custom-Domains-service-deprecation).

To be honest, I struggled with keeping the blog up-to-date. In many of my posts,
I would make commitments to write more often which turned out to never come true.
Not only that, I felt as though I had limited myself in the number of topics I
could write about since the original blog was geared towards programming and
Computer Science.

Thus, when my old domain expired and the link to my Medium publication broke, I
decided to not fix it and instead told myself that I will host my own blog. Along
with that, I also made the decision to not limit myself in the type of content I
write about. What does that mean for this blog then? Well, anything goes. Be it
related to programming, philosophy, design, or my day, I won't think twice and
worry about whether or not a post should belong on this blog.

Although I pretty much failed at having a blog before, I do enjoy writing (even
if I'm bad at it) and hope this blog will allow me to pursue this passion further.
So for now, I bid you adieu and I look forward to see where things go from here.
