This piece was originally going to be called "Why I Write". For better or worse
(and advised as okay by Paul Graham), I've since pivoted the main topic of this
post to instead focus more generally on my motivation to create--be it via
writing, programming, designing, or drawing. But this post does not only focus
on the motivation why I do these activities, rather, it also looks at why I don't
do these things when required of me, namely academically-speaking.

<!-- 
  Elaborate on why it was going to be "why I write" and how the shift in focus occurred
  "why I write?" turned into "why do I partake in any creative endeavor?"
  esp. since I should be doing so in school but ultimately don't
 -->

<!--
  Make note of why this is important - hopefully better understand myself
  and make the appropriate changes (makes sense with New Years right around the corner)
-->

Thus, through the inquisition of myself and some research, this essay aims to
answer the following questions:

 - Can lazy people, who do not apply themselves academically, pursue creative
   and/or mentally-demanding endeavors?

 - What motivates these individuals?

 - Can said motivation be applied towards performing at a higher level academically?


<!--
  Myself as case study
   - explain relationship w/ school
   - grades
   - general performance
-->


<!-- 
  With my own thoughts on the topic (refletion) & answers from reddit,
  answer all three questions
 -->

 <!-- 
  With answers in mind, think about what can be changed and/or done differently
  in order to lead a better lifestyle in terms of school
  -->
