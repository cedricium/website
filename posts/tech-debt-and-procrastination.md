Second day in a row that I blog—I officially have a writing streak going!

In today's post, I want to talk about why I've made so little progress on
[Unearth](https://www.tryunearth.com) in recent weeks.

There are several reasons why I haven't contributed to Unearth, some of which
being:

- busy with internship during the day, school in the evenings
- Unearth being feature-complete; no sexy new features to implement
- not monetized so there is no extrinsic motivation

All of these are valid reasons why I wouldn't want to continue working on the
project. However, combined they still do not make up for the majority of my
procrastination to update Unearth.

The significant reason for my lack of procrastination is due to Unearth's
[technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)—"the implied cost
of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead
of using a better approach that would take longer."

With nearly 200 registered users, over 85,000 Reddit saves synced, and numerous
recommendations for improvements, I know there are changes that need to be made
to make Unearth a more intuitive product. But due to the way I architected the
project early on, it will take some major refactoring to implement said changes.

solution:

- make a plan
  - just like with procrastination in other areas (school, work, etc.), the main
    cause is due to a lack in a plan
