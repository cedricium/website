One thing I've noticed since starting my writing challenge is the number of
ideas I can come up with on any given day.

Now, those ideas are not always good—often they are quite simple, and writing
more than a tweets-length about them can be difficult. The problem is I end up
choosing those exact topics since they are easy to write about and take little
effort on my part.

I bring this is up is because I haven't been particularly happy with the quality
of my recent posts. When I started this challenge, the only rule put in place
was the need to write every day.

David Perell said it best in a recent tweet:

> Writing a lot won’t make you a better writer.
>
> If it did everybody who answers 100 emails per day would write like Hemmingway
> [sic].
>
> If you want to improve your writing, listen to critical feedback, read great
> books, and spend a lot of time _re-writing_ your sentences.<sup>1</sup>

When I first developed the interest to start writing I had a specific goal in
mind: I wanted to write more informative pieces backed with evidence from
outside resources in the hopes of teaching my readers something.

This desire to teach and have a more authoritative writing style was heavily
influenced by Julian Shapiro's
[_Writing Well_](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro) guide. In it, he
explains the benefits of writing, some of which include becoming "…a better
all-around thinker" and getting to "…send strangers down paths they badly
needed."

I'm currently reading Nadia Eghbal's latest book, _Working in Public: The Making
and Maintenance of Open Source Software_, and she does an amazing job of doing
just that. The book is essentially a collection of essays, each more informative
than the next, and containing lots of notes from her years-long research on the
topic.

I feel as though I never quite mastered this particular style of writing, which
is similar to the kind of essays one would be required to write in school. I
guess my end goal is ultimately to be a creator whose work is helpful to others.

At this point, I'm worried my daily writing challenge may be doing more harm
than good, or at the least not having the intended effect of driving me towards
becoming a better writer. Says Julian on writers who publish on a fixed
schedule:

> Efficient reading:
>
> Writers who post frequently (2x/wk) are rarely worth reading consistently.
>
> I read for insights. And no writer can generate profound insights on a fixed
> schedule.
>
> I aggregate writers who publish sporadically. When they post, they truly have
> something to say.<sup>2</sup>

For my desired writing style, this makes sense: If I have to write every day,
then I will not have time to research topics. So I may need to rethink my
writing challenge, at the least altering how often I publish new posts.

I think this somewhat meta idea on the benefits of writing could make for a
great first essay so I may explore it further.
