  "Back from a three year writing hiatus and making two too many Eminem
  references for my liking."

## _…back again. Cedric's back, tell a friend._

Apologies, listened to a lot of Eminem since the last time I was here.

Speaking of which, it's been just over three years since I last published a
post, and two-ish of those years the blog wasn't even live. With a newly
designed, developed, and deployed personal site (you like?), I'm excited to
bring back my old writing and start putting out new content as well.

During the hiatus, I traded one creative outlet (writing) for another
(sketching). If I've learned anything from drawing it's that a lot of patience
and letting go of one's ego is required in order to make any progress. Hoping to
keep those same lessons in mind with writing this time around.

### What's Been Up Man?

(Dammit, there I go again. If you know, you know).

Jeez, writing in full sentences at a little past 1:00AM is hard. I really do
need to work out this writing muscle. For now I'm going to take the easy way out
and list the major updates as a bulleted list. (Each item could probably be its
own post so this will be a good brainstorming session anyways.)

- [Unearth](https://github.com/tryunearth) was shut down (#RIP). Never made any
  progress [monetizing the product](/blog/towards-monetization.md), mostly due
  to focusing on my career and hardly using the product much myself. Shout out
  to the 300+ Redditors who registered and used it, hopefully some of you all
  found it valuable.
- Hellosaurus and YC startup life. A rewarding two years building awesome stuff
  with amazing people capped with an
  [acquisition by Brilliant.org](https://www.hellosaurus.com/blog/hellosaurus-joins-brilliant-to-bring-interactive-experiences-to-millions-of-learners).
- Short-lived time at connectRN. According to
  [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/), more than 525,000 people in the tech
  industry have been affected by layoffs since 2022. The business, which thrived
  during COVID-19 due to increased demand for healthcare workers, was bound to
  see a correction post-pandemic. Unfortunately, this correction came much
  sooner than anticipated.
- Funemployment, or trying to make the most of a crappy situation. Focusing on
  my mental and physical health (too embarrassed to share my Strava profile),
  fostering dogs through [Humane Society Silicon Valley](https://www.hssv.org/),
  and following pro cycling and Formula 1 are just some of the things I've been
  up to while actively searching for work.

Am I forgetting anything else? I think that's about it. Check back soon for
deeper dives into some of those aforementioned topics.

Until then, ✌️
