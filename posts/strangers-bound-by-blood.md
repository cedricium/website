How is one supposed to feel when a stranger passes away?

Now what if that stranger was once a part of your early childhood? What if you
both share the same blood and what if that stranger was the one who brought you
into this world?

Recent events have forced me to consider these questions today.

I will be able to address these sentiments tomorrow in my weekly therapy session
but as of now I cannot bring myself to think (or write) about anything else.

This short update will have to suffice.
