I'm easily drawn to exciting new things but rarely do I familiarize myself enough beyond just scratching the surface to become a "expert". This all makes me what is often referred to as a [generalist](https://medium.com/@jchyip/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437).

As I've gotten older, I've become less content with having minimal skills in many areas. So when the urge to write and the feeling of not being an amazing writer came over me, I decided to challenge myself.

Inspired by [Pat Wall's blog](https://patwalls.com), I am going to attempt to write everyday. I will not impose a time frame for how many days in a row I should write. Instead I will focus on [building the habit of writing everyday](https://jamesclear.com/repetitions) to become a better writer.

Over time after having [created a large volume of work](./advice-for-beginners) will my writing improve.
