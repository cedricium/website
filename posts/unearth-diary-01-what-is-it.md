This is the first article in a series of articles where I discuss my long-time
side project, Unearth. Topics will include the motivation behind building Unearth,
what it is, how it works, and the technology behind it to name a few. Check back
often for future updates.

### Too Much Content, Too Little Time

Many Redditors, myself included, like to save posts and comments that make us a
feel some type a way. Whether it's a funny meme, a recipe for a delicious meal,
or an in-depth programming tutorial, we don't always have the time to act on the
media we consume. So, with good intentions, we save it for later. The problem
is: later never comes. Consumption of media has become an all-consuming act and
rarely do we remember to go back and look at our saved things with what little
time we have on our hands.

That's when I thought: maybe all we need is a simple nudge or reminder every so
often that surfaces the content for us, similar to Timehop.

My solution to this issue of rediscovering saved content is (what I think is
aptly named) Unearth. It's a service that sends users a personalized newsletter
with a handful of their Reddit saves at the frequency of their choice. No longer
can we place the blame on our forgetfulnessâ€”with Unearth, we can be shown some
of our Reddit saves as frequently as every day.

### Why Reddit

There are a couple reasons why Reddit was chosen as the initial platform to
surface saved content. For starters, I, myself, am a Redditor and have saved
over 800 items since joining the site seven years ago. The second reason is due
to Reddit's own technical limitations. It's widely known yet not totally
understood that only the most recent thousand saved items can be accessed/viewed.
Once you go past those thousand items, the oldest content disappears in order
to make space for the newer saves.

A majority of the content I save could be beneficial for me at some point in my
life, however, even I know I don't need all of those saved things. So Unearth's
purpose is two-fold: not only does it surface content frequently for you, but
it also helps you manage your saved things by encouraging you to unsave unneeded
content.

Although Reddit was initially chosen, the great thing about Unearth is that its
core functionality can be extended to many different platforms or services which
offer access to users' data. Since showing off Unearth to a handful of people,
I've already had people ask me to extend this to sites like Twitter, Facebook,
and Hacker News in order to surface their likes and bookmarks.
