In spite of these dire times, I've tried to make the most of the extra time by
reading more. To my surprise, I have read more books in the past two-ish months
than I have in my entire adult life. Like they say, "it's never too late [to
become a reader]."

Below are the books I have read, I am currently reading, and I wish to read
while stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Wishlist

_Update (April 20, 2020)_

Finished two of the books I was reading when I
originally published this post. I also wanted to add a link to my [Goodread's
"Want to Read" list](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/15263017-cedric?shelf=to-read)
which is a little more comprehensive than the Wishlist
above.

Speaking of reading lists, I came across a super cool site today on Product
Hunt: Good Books (https://goodbooks.io). From their site:

> 6,500+ book recommendations from the most successful and interesting people
