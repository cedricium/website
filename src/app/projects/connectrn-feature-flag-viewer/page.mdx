## Context

**Goal / Problem**  
Access to the third-party feature flag management system (LaunchDarkly) was restricted by licensing costs, creating an engineering bottleneck. Team members often needed to check the status of a specific feature flag in development, staging, or production environments but lacked direct license access. The primary goal was to build an internal, read-only flag viewer that replicated key information, thereby reducing the number of required paid licenses.

**Role**  
**Project Lead** for the internal tool development, overseeing two junior engineers. My specific contributions included:

- **Scaffolding** the simple **React SPA** using **Vite**.
- **Collaborating with DevOps** to define and set up the CI/CD pipeline for the static site.
- **Defining the deliverables** and assigning tasks to the junior engineers based on their strengths.
- **Supervising** the development of flag fetching, display logic, and styling.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Vite
- **Backend:** LaunchDarkly API
- **Database:** N/A
- **Infra / DevOps:** AWS S3 (static hosting), GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

---

## Architecture Overview

The tool is a simple, high-performance **React Single-Page Application (SPA)** scaffolded with **Vite**. The frontend directly consumes the **LaunchDarkly API** using a read-only API key to fetch flag data. The application is a static site deployed and hosted via **AWS S3** for low-cost, high-availability serving. Deployment is managed automatically using a **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline**, which builds the React app and publishes the resulting static assets to the S3 bucket. This architecture ensured minimal maintenance overhead and high reliability.

---

## Implementation Highlights

- **Scaffolded a modern, performant React SPA** using Vite, establishing a scalable foundation for future internal tooling.
- **Integrated with the LaunchDarkly API** using a secure, read-only key to fetch real-time flag data across development, staging, and production environments.
- **Established a standardized CI/CD pipeline** via **GitHub Actions** for publishing internal static applications to **AWS S3**.
- **Mentored and managed** two junior engineers, delegating feature work (display logic, styling) to maximize team output.

---

## Challenges & Decisions

- **Decision:** Built a custom internal tool instead of purchasing more licenses.
  - **Rationale:** The business goal was purely to provide _read-only_ visibility into flag status for internal teams, which did not justify the cost of full LaunchDarkly seats. The tool provided 90% of the required functionality for 0% of the incremental license cost, directly fulfilling the cost-saving objective.

---

## Outcome / Impact

- Achieved an **annual licensing fee savings of $8,000** by eliminating the need for 30+ additional LaunchDarkly user seats.
- **Streamlined engineering workflows** by providing instant, self-service access to feature flag statuses, eliminating communication bottlenecks.
- Established a reusable **CI/CD pipeline and static site infrastructure** (React \+ Vite \+ AWS S3 \+ GitHub Actions) for future internal tooling.

---

## Lessons / Next Steps

- Gained experience in **leading and delegating work** to junior team members effectively, focusing on scaffolding and infrastructure while supervising feature delivery.
- Understood the significant financial impact of targeted internal tooling development as a replacement for costly external software licenses.
